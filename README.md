Not too long ago, in a not too far-away galaxy ...

A group of genius scientists has developed a bunch of incredible gadgets and weapons.
Their problem was the fact that they didn't want to test the these new technologies
themselves, so they decided to gather some people together to do it for them. This led to the
birth of Tech Champion, a bloody tournament, where contestants continue battling each other under different rules in
different locations and situations. Only one of them can be the Tech champion. Will it be you?
